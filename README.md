This was a final group project for a _Fundamentals of Programming_ class. We made use of a constant loop, plenty of conditionals, several system libraries. It's just a fun game that was modeled a partly after the fishing game in _Ocarina of Time_. It was voted the best project that semester and featured in a department-wide showcase. :trophy:
